# What is computational thinking?

Computers are able to execute complex calculations, but to do so, they require detailed instructions what to do. These instructions are *programming*, which just means that you write instructions to the computer and it executes them in a given sequence. Therefore, it becomes essential to know what kinds of commands need to be executed to get the expected outcome. This is known as *computational thinking*: reformulating a problem into an algorithm (set of instructions for the computer), which then can be translated into an executable program:

Here is an example of a simple program, can you guess what it does?

```{r}
print( 2 + 2 )
```

`{r}` here is a symbol we use to indicate that the code is written in R language, `print` is a command to print something and `2 + 2` is a mathematical operation we ask the program to execute. Let us try something a different, can you make the block below to print your age? You can edit it directly below:

```{r}
print( 2025 - 1900 )
```

Beyond numbers, we can also print text. To indicate that something is text, we put the text inside quotations like this `"This is text."` Here is an example:

```{r}
print("This is text.")
```

Can you modify the code above to print your name instead of `This is text.`?

# Variables

Beyond doing mathematics, we often want to store things - be that text, number or something else - to computers memory and access it later. For this purpose we use *variables* which you can think as boxes which have *a label* (the name of the variable) and *contents*, i.e., what is stored to said variable.

![](./figures/datastructure_variables.png)

We have three variables, named `age1`, `age2` and `age3`. We can then use these as usual: we can for example calculate what is `age2 - age1`. In R, this is written like this:

```{r}
age1 <- 25 ## you can also use = instead of <-
age2 <- 35
age3 <- 45 

print( age2 - age1 )
```

As the name variable indicates, its value can change during the execution. Most interestingly, its value can change in relation to itself. Before running this code, try to read and guess what it prints!

```{r}
sum <- 0
sum <- sum + 2
sum <- sum + 3
sum <- sum * 2
print( sum )
```

For text in R, one cannot use the `+` operator, rather to merge text together use the `paste` command:

```{r}
text <- paste("Combine", "texts", "and", sum)
print( text )
```

## Exercises

How long Emperor Nero lived and what proportion of that time he was in power. He was born on 37 ad, died on 68 ad, and reigned from 54 to 68 ad.

```{r}
nero_birth_year <- 37
```

A flat costs 250,000 euros and has an area of 75 m2. What is the price of the flat per square meter?

```{r}

```

# Loops and conditions

## Repeating and `for` loop

The above examples we have conducted the commands line by line, in order. However, often there is a need to repeat some commands; for example the same code used above to calculate Nero's reign is the same needed to calculate any emperor's reign if we have access to the years. However, instead of copy-pasting the above lines we rather say to the computer that repeat these command several times. For that purpose, programming languages have a `for`-loop.

```{r}
for( stepper in 1:10 ) {
    print( stepper )
}
```

The following code prints out numbers `1`, `2`, ..., `10`. Similarly we could approach reading a file, line by line

```{r}
data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codingsocialscience/data/refs/heads/master/emperors_full.txt", header = F)
for( i in 1:nrow(data) ){
    name <- data[i, 1]
    birth_year <- data[i, 2]
    death_year <- data[i, 3]
    start_of_regin <- data[i, 4]
    end_of_regin <- data[i, 5]
    print( name )
}
```

Use the code you wrote above and modify the example to calculate the age of each emperor's age and length of their reign.

```{r}
data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codingsocialscience/data/refs/heads/master/emperors_full.txt", header = F)
for( i in 1:nrow(data) ){
    name <- data[i, 1]
    birth_year <- data[i, 2]
    death_year <- data[i, 3]
    start_of_regin <- data[i, 4]
    end_of_regin <- data[i, 5]
    print( name )
}
```

## Controlling the execution order and `if`-structure

Often there is a need to only execute some commands if some condition takes place. For example, you taken an umbrella with you if it will rain:

![](./figures/ifexpression.png)

In various programming languages this is known as the `if`-structure. If structure relates to some *condition*, checking if some statement is true or false. For example if we were interested only on the age of Julius Nepos, we could check if the name corresponds to this:

```{r}
data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codingsocialscience/data/refs/heads/master/emperors_full.txt", header = F)
for( i in 1:nrow(data) ){
    name <- data[i, 1]
    birth_year <- data[i, 2]
    death_year <- data[i, 3]
    start_of_regin <- data[i, 4]
    end_of_regin <- data[i, 5]
    if( name == "Julius Nepos") {
        print( name )
    }
}
```

The example shows the syntax for a conditional execution: it checks if name equals to (in R, `==` is read as equals to as one `=` is reserved for assigning a value to variable), and if it is true, the code *inside* `{}` is executed; if not, the code is ignored. Can you modify the code to check for emperors who were likely (but not for sure) killed as emperors?

```{r}
data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codingsocialscience/data/refs/heads/master/emperors_full.txt", header = F)
for( i in 1:nrow(data) ){
    name <- data[i, 1]
    birth_year <- data[i, 2]
    death_year <- data[i, 3]
    start_of_regin <- data[i, 4]
    end_of_regin <- data[i, 5]
    if( name == "Julius Nepos") {
        print( name )
    }
}
```

By completing this exercise, you have now conducted *computational thinking*: you have taken an actual problem (likely killed as emperors), considered how our limited data could be used to find such cases, and then translated this insight into a form that a computer can understand. This is the essence of computational thinking and programming.

ðŸ’¬ Speak with a partner nearby: what kind of similar tasks can you identify in your own research work?

# Patterns for computational thinking

We have this far examined

-   what variables are and how they can change
-   how to repeat instructions
-   how to conditionally execute instructions

Now let us put these building blocks into use and combine them into commonly used patterns such as *the gatherer*. A gatherer is used to accumulate values on the basis of other variables in some manner. There are several types of gatherers, utilizing various approaches to accumulation.

For example, to calculate the mean age of emperors, we would summing all the age values and then dividing the result by the number of emperors.

```{r}
data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codingsocialscience/data/refs/heads/master/emperors_full.txt", header = F)

## two gatherers
age_sum <- 0
emperor_count <- 0

for( i in 1:nrow(data) ){
    name <- data[i, 1]
    birth_year <- data[i, 2]
    death_year <- data[i, 3]
    start_of_regin <- data[i, 4]
    end_of_regin <- data[i, 5]
    age <- 0 ## fix me
    age_sum <- age_sum + age
    emperor_count <- emperor_count + 1 
}
```

The statement `age_sum <- age_sum + age` increases age_sum by age. Similarly, `emperor_count <- emperor_count + 1` increases by one after processing each row, thus producing the count of emperors.

To understand the code, you can pair up and for a [few first rows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codingsocialscience/data/refs/heads/master/emperors_full.txt), think what are the values of `age`, `age_sum` and `emperor_count`.

## Exercises

```{r}

```

Data file [`elections.txt`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codingsocialscience/data/refs/heads/master/elections.txt) contains candidates names, their parties, their vote counts and their birth year so that each candidate is on a single row:

```         
Beatrice Vestergard,PartyA,643092,1982
Titta-Riina Aapola,PartyA,443565,1998
Mikko-Pekka Kaunismaa,PartyB,100104,1990
```

2.  Calculate the number of candidates in PartyA.

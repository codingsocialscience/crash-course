# Computational thinking and social sciences: A crash course

This engaging workshop offers a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental components of computational thinking and programming, tailored specifically for social scientists.
Participants will explore key programming concepts, including variables, if-statements, and for-loops, while gaining a deeper understanding of how programming involves issuing precise commands that a computer executes step-by-step.
We therefore train how social scientists can translate their research questions into computational problems that a computer can effectively address;
thus trying to find a balance between more advanced methods and more substantive social science questions.

Moving beyond foundational programming skills, the workshop explores how to bridge computational methods to usual social science methods.
Therefore, we quickly explore practical applications of machine learning in analysing survey data and focus on data scientists' strategies to enhance accuracy and predictability in their models; discussing how such strategies can be applied in social science questions.
